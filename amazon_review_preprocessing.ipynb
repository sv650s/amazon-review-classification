      "review_body_orig\t[ok I recieved the PLD70BT unit last week on friday, it arrived in perfect condition and on time!   (ordered from amazon not a third party)   I bought this unit for my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad cab.    a few years back I bought a Pyle PLD45MUT (3.5 inch screen and tv tuner built in.) which after about 2 or 3 years stopped playing the DVD's or CD's and thus was not much use as my kids love to bring CD's in the car and torture me! anyway, I had to buy a wiring adaptor for the old unit and I kept it all wired after I took it out of the truck and shelved it. so when I recieved the new unit I was thrilled to see thaat the Pyle wiring harness was exactly the same from unit to unit and I just popped it off the old unit and onto the new one and it slid right into place in the dash! so if you have a Pyle unit already You can upgrade to this one pretty easy!     ok, that being said let's talk about this unit. it's a good unit for the price and so far I am very satisfied! the sound is good(I will expand on this in a minute) and has adjustments and the menu's are easy to negotiate. the touch screen is responsive and easy to use, and the remote is good with the only complaint being that it takes the unit 1 second to respond to the command you send from the remote, if you get used to this delay it works great. now as for the sound, the radio is LOUD! it cranks and sounds good till about 2/3 up and then starts to distort just a bit, but not too bad. the thing is when you change to the card reader or CD, or possibly USB drive (I haven't tried yet) the volume is much lower, and you can literaly turn the unit all the way up and never get it as loud as the radio itself! I dono't understand this , but it's true of my unit. and the bluetooth MP3 player I connected was even quieter through the system, these are 320kbs P3 rips and they are just quiet via bluetooth, I plan to try other devices to see if maybe its an issue with my player or what.      while I had the factory stereo in the dash I had hooked up a couple of speaker line taps to go to an amp, when I hooked up the new system it was sounding crappy at first, bu then I took out the old connection and used the RCA outputs from the PLD70BT and it sounds better than it ever has! I use the connecter to connect to a 100x4 amp which drive a pair of 150w Speakers set to Low pass on the amp, and WOW who needs subs?!?!?! this thing kicks some serious BASS! it can sometimes be overwhelming if the loudness is on and a deep preset EQ is selected.     in all if you want a good system with some cool features this one will do! and nicely!    I will post an Update and a video review later in the week after I get time to play with it some more.]\n",

      "review_body_orig\t[Awful phone. You will never be able to update this phone past Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. This is a huge problem as 4.4 KitKat and later versions allowed more apps to be stored on an SD card. You might think, well, there's 16GB built in, that's plenty of space. Here's where you realize how shady ZTE as a company is. It's not a single 16GB chip. It's a 4GB chip where the OS and all your apps live. And a 12GB chip for other things like photos. Since you can't move most apps, you are left with constantly running out of space. The specs seem great, but when you actually look into it, you see that it's a much worse value than anything else in the price range.<br /><br />Besides the space issue, there's the battery issue. It's small to begin with. It isn't user replaceable. Normally, that's not an issue for me, I'm not one of the ones to decry non-removable batteries. I had an iPhone and never had a problem, same with some other Android phones. Except, around the 6 month mark, like other reviewers have noticed, the battery life nosedives. I unplug my charger at 8AM in the morning, and when 2PM rolls around I'm at 10%, and it did nothing other than sit in my pocket asleep.<br /><br />Then there's the restarts. This thing randomly locks up and restarts, whether it was in use at the time or not. Other software issues include the alarm clock not working, and my personal favorite - deleting all my files. I had a PIN on my lockscreen. After 10 failed attempts, it resets the phone - pretty standard. One day, my phone decided to forget what my PIN was. Meaning, I entered the correct PIN - it wasn't something that I forgot, it wasn't something that changed - and it would deny access. It's like the phone completely forgot what the correct PIN was, there was nothing to do but keep trying in hopes that it would recognize the correct PIN. It did not, and reformatted everything.<br /><br />This phone looks great on paper, but it's actually pure trash. I don't trust ZTE as a company, and would never buy from them again.]\n",
