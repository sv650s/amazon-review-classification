      "review_body_orig\t[This is my 2nd pair of &#34;over the ear&#34; bluetooth headphones. I started back at the gym 6 months ago and used the typical ear buds with a cord. It didn't take long before I was losing my phone on the treadmill because of the cord catching a part of my body. I am huge on quality of sound and how well I can keep sound out. I bought a set of JAMS first and they lasted me for about 4 months. I absolutely loved them but the left side completely went out. I read reviews on this problem shortly after it happened. I really wanted that great sound (bass in particular) and was skeptical to buy another set of JAMS. After research and reviews, I found these bad boys. They are a little bulky but hey, so are the BEATS. Whats better than the BEATS is that they are only $50!!! I have never tried BEATS ($299) but I can tell you, I don't know how you could possibly get any better sound...<br />I use these for mowing the yard and the gym. That said, I do a serious amount of sweating. They are extremely comfortable. They stay on whether I am in another world running to some killer electronics dance music or laying flat on my back doing bench press.<br />If I were able to give 10 stars on here, it still wouldn't be enough...<br />And for the ones that state they can't get theirs to pair with their devices... Its very simple! I have paired them with my Galaxy S5 Active, as well as the IPhone 5S. You have to hold the power button down longer after &#34;she&#34; tells you power is on. Wait for her to say &#34;pairing&#34;. Once you hear that, set your phone to scan. NOTE!!! YOU NEED TO SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN AND LOOK FOR &#34;AVAILABLE&#34; DEVICES...]\n",
