# Deep Learning Notebooks

All notebooks are Google Colab notebooks so I can make use of their GPU for training

All models are implemented in TF2/Keras

# Google Drive Setup

In order to run these notebooks you will want to create the following directories in your Google Drive

```buildoutcfg
├── Springboard - main directory
    ├── capstone - main directory for this project
        ├── data - put your data files here
        ├── reports - all notebooks will store results in this directory
        ├── util - copy ../util*.py files here
```

## Reports

All notebooks wrote reports to the following directory:

```buildoutcfg
Springboard/capstone/reports
```

These reports are copied into this repo under ../reports
